# Introduction

Zaap provides a consistent, web-focused set of APIs that enable an app to stay as close to web standards as possible, while accessing rich native device features on platforms that support them.

## Get Started

Getting started with Zaap is easy! In the root of your app, install Zaap:

```bash
yarn add zaap-sdk
# or
npm install zaap-sdk
```
