# Introduction

Zaap is a cross-platform API and code execution layer that makes it easy to call Native SDKs from web code and to write custom native plugins that your app may need. Zaap provides a consistent, web-focused set of APIs that enable an app to stay as close to web standards as possible, while accessing rich native device features on platforms that support them.

## Get Started

Zaap was designed to drop-in to any existing modern web app. Run the following commands to initialize Zaap in your app:

```bash
yarn add zaap-sdk
# or
npm install zaap-sdk
```

## Plugins
